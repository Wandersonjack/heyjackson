      "'When building out the platform, BitOfProperty did not put much effort into UI/UX. We outsourced the service, which left us in a difficult position, as we were unable to respond to our client's problems and needs.

Thus, it was one of the areas that were lacking to build trust in our service'. Karl Vaan - CEO."
